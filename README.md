# Sleepy Squad's Dreamwalk

## What is this?
This is a game created for Quinnipiac's SER225 Agile Development class by Sleepy Squad (Credited below.)
Dreamwalk is a small RPG that has cute elements, but has a "dark" turn in the game.

## How to run this project?
We did not use any external libraries for this, so you can clone this repo as is and run it out of the box with Java (min version 8).
We recommend using an IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse to run this game.

The main method for the game is in the `Game` package > `Game.java` file.<br>
The main method for the map editor is in the `MapEditor` package > `MapEditor.java` file.
